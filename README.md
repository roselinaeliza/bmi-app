# bmi-app
Intro to Programming Final Presentation.

This is an app where users could calculate their BMI by entering their age, gender, height, and weight.
The program will automatically calculate the users' BMI, based on the data given by the users, and display the result.
The program then will ask the users to input their weight target and the amount of days they want to reach the target.
Based on the input, the program will calculate how much calories that the users need to lose/gain per day, in order to achieve their target.
